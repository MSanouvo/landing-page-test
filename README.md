# landing-page-test

My take on the landing page project for The Odin Project.
I followed the instructions mostly 1 for 1. I didn't have the creative power to personalize it myself but that may change in the future.
Overall I spent around 4ish hours. The CSS is passable, but not perfect. I am comfortable with writing HTML with the objective of creating a webpage layout. Once I learn javascript in order to add functionality I may come back to this.
